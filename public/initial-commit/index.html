  <p>Yeah so if after a year your email list is the same size it&rsquo;s a safe bet to move on. Every single marketing tactic says you need to build an email list and maintain a newsletter to keep your readers engaged and network with other authors.</p>
<p>The issue with that is your readers aren&rsquo;t just reading you. They are subscribed to thirty other newsletters and even with Substack&rsquo;s app it can be hard to keep up.</p>
<p>It works great for my <a href="https://mosfetmag.substack.com/">MOSFET Mag</a> because it&rsquo;s not a consistently updated site. I basically use it to store short fiction that got rejected one too many times. Using it as a magazine works just great. Other folks offer paid subscriptions and by all means do it if you can get them but I couldn&rsquo;t produce paid-quality writing on a consistent basis.</p>
<p>When I was using Write.as I loved how easy it was to jot a thought in markdown and hit send. Substack uses a rich text editor, Wordpress uses some kind of div salad, and well - Twitter is just for shower/toilet thoughts.</p>
<p>Back to the old text-based blog format for me!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never made it this far with a static site generator blog. I attempted a Jekyl build long ago and gave up after too many failed installs - Ruby and I don&rsquo;t get along apparently. But Hugo is pretty easy to use from a text editor. I&rsquo;m currently using VS Code and pushing the updates to github who is hosting the pages.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also kind of stoked to be going back to text-based blogging.</p>
