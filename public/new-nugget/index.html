  <p>I got a new music nugget last week. For those who don&rsquo;t know I like to listen to music separate from my phone. This is due to all the spam calls and notifications I get on my main device that make listening to music or podcasts difficult with all the constant interrupts.</p>
<p><img src="/phonejack.jpeg" alt="iphone"></p>
<p>During the pandemic I picked up a couple of <a href="https://jetgirl.writeas.com/nows-a-good-time-to-go-back-to-mp3s">broken Zunes</a> and <a href="https://jetgirl.art/so-you-want-to-fix-up-a-zune/">fixed them up</a> to listen to offline music.</p>
<p>I still download music from musicians on Bandcamp and have been buying cassettes and vinyl from others, but for discovering music I still use - the internet, and streaming. As much fun as it is to have a dedicated mp3 player for high fidelity songs, moving podcast mp3&rsquo;s is a chore and none of the cars we have now like to read from an aux source.</p>
<p>I love the Zune, but its proprietary cable is a crunchy mess and adding songs to it is no longer easy. Last year I bought a used iPod Classic and used that for a while until the audio jack went haywire on me and now gives static. Then I won a free nugget from a music discord group which was an old android Go Phone that still had a phone jack. It&rsquo;s great for streaming songs but eats the battery in a few hours and the android OS is extremely laggy and frustrating to use.</p>
<p>So that brings me to the new nugget, the iPhone SE (2016 model). Why the iPhone SE? Well, it is the LAST iPhone to be shipped with a phone jack. Another bonus is that it&rsquo;s got the normal lightning cable (no giant pin cable) and I can access the old battery with screws instead of ungluing things when the battery does eventually get spicy.</p>
<p>I bought this one for $50 off a used phone store called Swappy. YMMV.</p>
<p><img src="/nuggets.jpeg" alt="iphone"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also so much smaller than the android that I can throw it in my pocket without problems. The android is nearly as big as my 13 max which is like a micro tablet more than a phone. This SE has a 4 inch screen and is exactly what you need to quickly tap around and open the podcast app or Bandcamp or whatever without the lag. It&rsquo;s not as light and simple as the Zune but nothing is ever going to be. Even the Sandisk Clips we have are a smadge heavier than my Zune.</p>
<p>The cable on my PortaPro&rsquo;s has gone and messed itself up, they were kinda weak but it cuts out now when trying to listen to stuff so I&rsquo;m back to using my Sony EX155AP earbuds. For $20 they are good enough and don&rsquo;t hurt my ears. (Don&rsquo;t bother suggesting AirPods Pro, I had those, they hurt.) I&rsquo;ll probably save up for some Sennheiser somethings but until then these Sony buds will do fine.</p>
