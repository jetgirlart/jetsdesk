### Welcome to the blog

*Let me just move some papers out of the way...*

That's better!

So, after the last few years of using Substack as a main blog I've dialed things back - all the way back to just the HTML. 

- Giant images - gone! 
- Annoying CTA popups - gone! 
- Shady javascript - gone! 
- Substack's walled garden - gone! 
- Spamming your inbox - gone!

A blog is not a newsletter. A blog is not for marketing. A blog is just a causal public notebook of thoughts and ideas, and that's the goal with this one.
